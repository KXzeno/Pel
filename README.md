<h3 align="center"><p>All soft/hardware have or should have fault recognition, and as meticulously crafted they can be, it's no different than how we must bootstrap ourselves for self-improvement. Pel is a digital field note-taking app conceived through the struggle of containing and reviewing data within a monolithic text file, organizing data with the intent of grounding oneself to analytical retrospection or priority inheritance.</p></h3>

# Project Roadmap
1. Design general UX/UI
2. Create sort and query patterns using intuitive, categorical designs
3. Implement reasonable routing strategy for nodes; /E1 -> /E1/2C1 -> /E1/2C1/T2 where each code can instead be their unique identifiers. UIDs are only unique to their contexts
4. Implement dynamic timeline interface for notes/events
5. Add presets for how timelines are constructed
6. Implement priority inheritance via timeline node relationships
7. Design algorithm for which nodes/timelines to notify the user of "worthy", immediate retrospection
8. Implement cookie/session-based caching for guests
9. Implement auth.js for database integration, allowing full features; follows a whitelist unless database options expand
10. Produce external data encryption in case of data leaks
